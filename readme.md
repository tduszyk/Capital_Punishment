# Capital Punishment in the US

## Applying ML to find out if changes how change of rules changed application of Capital Punishment.

Pre-1972: Application of death penalty for all sorts of crimes that are not the most serious.  Judges could unilaterally impose capital punishment discretionarily (racial bias).

Post-1976: Application of the death penalty only for “most serious” crimes.  Usually 1st degree murder PLUS an aggravating factor (rape, robbery, etc).

NOTE: Because 1976 Supreme Court Ruling restricted the scope of the death penalty, certain methods of execution were also curtailed as “cruel and unusual”.
